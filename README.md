# Sales Data Analysis Summary ï¿½

This repository contains an analysis of sales data performed in a **Jupyter Notebook** and summarized through five key visualizations.

## **Visualizations**

1. **Sales_by_product.png**  
   - Identifies the highest and lowest-selling products.  
   - Helps guide inventory and marketing focus.

2. **Sales_by_region_boxplot.png**  
   - Compares sales distributions across regions.  
   - Highlights median sales, variability, and outliers.  
   - Shows regions with consistently high sales and regions with inconsistent performance.

3. **Sales_amount_histogram.png**  
   - Shows that most transactions are for lower sales amounts (right-skewed).  
   - Indicates that high-value sales are less frequent, which is typical for a broad customer base.

4. **Correlation_heatmap.png**  
   - Reveals the strength and direction of relationships between business metrics (e.g., price, quantity, profit).  
   - Helps identify key drivers of sales and profit.

5. **Scatterplot.png**  
   - Confirms the relationship between two specific variables (e.g., Quantity Sold vs. Profit).  
   - Reinforces findings from the correlation heatmap.

## **Key Insights**

- Distinct differences exist in **product performance**.  
- **Regional sales consistency** varies, with some regions outperforming others.  
- Certain business factors are strongly correlated with overall **sales and profit**, highlighting areas for strategic focus.
